	w27: .asciiz "\nDoes Yang speak with an accent?\n"
	w28: .asciiz "\nYeah!  He's always talking funny, especially when Marcus is here!  They just play in Yang's room with the door closed and won't let me in, hmph\n"
	w29: .asciiz "\n--Will stands in stunned silence while you rush downstairs--\n"
	w291: .asciiz "\nXing!  What have I told you about answering the door?\nYou pick her up and plop her onto the living room couch.  As Will stands there, still shocked, Marcus comes down the stairs as well, fixing his clothes\n"
	w292: .asciiz "\nMarcus?  What are you doing here?  A-And why are you wearing Sunny's shirt?\n"
	w293: .asciiz "\nHm?  Oh, hey Will.  I'm just here to babysit Xing while you two hang out.  As for the shirt, mine got muddy on my walk here, so Sunny let me borrow one.\n"
	w294: .asciiz "\nOh, okay I thought you two were -- Nevermind.\n"
	w295: .asciiz "\nYou walk up to Will and Marcus, ready to leave.  After you wave your sister bye, you two get into Will's car and drive off\n"	
	w31: .asciiz "\nYou 'just happened' to be standing right in front of the door when he came, and swing it open quickly.  He stares in mild shock before smiling nervously\n"

	ride2: .asciiz "\nAs you both ride in the car, only Will tries to talk.  You, however, only give him short answers to any questions, and don't make conversation very easy.\nYou notice he gives up small talk, blushing in shame.  He turns on the radio to fill the silence, but you turn it off.\n\nI hate that song.'\n"
	date10: .asciiz "\nSoon, you both arrive at the destination for your date.  An ice rink.  It's completely empty, and you ask Will why.\n"
	date1Options: .asciiz "\nOption 1: Joke around\nOption 2: Ask a reasonable question\nOption 3: Joke around, just with a different joke\n"
	date1: .asciiz "\nWhat are you gonna do, kill me?\n"
	date11: .asciiz "\nWill looks at you and smiles, but doesn't say anything else.  You're weirded out and turn to walk ahead and grab some skates, however, Will stops you.  You turn and look, but a glint of light catches your eyes.  In Will's hand is a knife.\n"
	date12: .asciiz "\nWhelp, at least the date's not awkward anymore.\n"
	date13: .asciiz "\nHe thrusts the hand holding the knife forward, but you dodge.  Luckily, your dad taught you and your sister how to fight when you were younger\n"
	date14Options: .asciiz "\nOption 1: Attempt to knock the knife out of his hands\nOption 2: Run away like those idiots in the scary movies\n"
	date141: .asciiz "\nAs you both stand there, watching the other, Will attempts to stab you again.  You step to the side, then hit his wrist, and the knife slides across the ice.\nWhile he watches it get further and further away, you:\n"

	#During these 2 routes, you get killed either way
	date1411: .asciiz "\nYou surge forward, moving to strike Will, but before you even touch him he's kicking your legs out, and you fall to the floor.  Your head is hit pretty hard, but you force yourself to focus.  Will reaches towards you, and you realize he's going to attempt to choke you.  You:\n"
	date1411Options: .asciiz "\n1) Roll away\n2) Kick out at him when he gets close enough\n"
	date14Roll: .asciiz "\nYou try to roll away, but the ice makes you slip.  Will pins you down with his weight.  The knife is too far away for either of you right now, but it doesn't matter.  Will has already wrapped his hands around your neck.\nAs you stare up at him, your kicking legs becoming more frantic, you see that creepy smile come back to him.  The last thought you have before everything goes dark is...\n'This is the worst date I've ever been on.'\n"
	date14kick: .asciiz "\nJust as he gets close enough, you kick out at Will, hitting him right in the groin.  He bends over in pain and you try to crawl away quickly, but he recovers just as fast.  He grabs your ankle, pulls you closer and pins you down with his weight.  He's too angry to simply choke you now and instead raises your head, then slams it back down onto the ice.  It's hard to focus once again, and everything around you is going dark.  Your very last thought before everything ends is...'This jerk better not show up at my funeral.'\n"
	
	#Run1 for date141Options.  The knife has slid across the ice, and you're staring at each other
	dateRun1: .asciiz "\nYou both stare at each other, then bolt at the same time; Will slides across the ice for the knife and you run for the door.\n"
	#Run2 for 14ptions.  You run away while he still has the knife in his hands
	dateRun2: .asciiz "\nTrying to turn and run, you slip after forgetting you're both on the ice.  Will comes up behind you, and brings the knife down.  Your last thought before everything goes dark is...\n'They better not put something stupid on my grave stone.'\n"
	
	date143: .asciiz "\nYou panic when you realize you and him are the only ones around.  The woods are just behind the rink, and the road around this part of the city is always empty.  You...\n"
	date144: .asciiz "\n1) Run for the woods; at least this way you have the option to hide\n2) Pick up that nearby rock and hide behind the ice rink doors\n"
	date1441: .asciiz "\nYou sprint away into the underbrush of the forest, snapping twigs beneath your feet.  Behind you the rink doors slam open, but you don't dare look back.  You worry for only a moment; Will's in football, what if he catches up to you?  Then you remember you've played soccer ever since you were able to walk.  There's only a small chance he'll catch up.\n"
	date1442: .asciiz "\nAt first, Will's heavy footfalls are all you hear.  You stress out, but slowly they begin to become distant.  With the combination of adrenaline and high stamina, Will is left panting a ways away, yet you keep running.  You don't stop until you see he's out of sight, nor do you stop when you're sure you're halfway lost through the forest.\n"
	date1443: .asciiz "\nYou see lights ahead of you, and you finally reach the edge of the forest.  In front of you lies your neighborhood and despite your legs shaking and your chest heaving, you force yourself to keep going until you're finally standing in front of your front door.\n"
	date1444: .asciiz "\nIn the corner of your eye, you see Will's car turning into the street, and you quickly run inside before locking the door.  Your friend Marcus pokes his head out from behind the couch, and your little sister Xing is sat beside him. \n"
	date1445: .asciiz "\nWoah, what's up Sunny?  What happened to you and Will hanging out?\n"
	date1446: .asciiz "\nWill pulled a knife on me!  Get Xing upstairs, now!\n"
	date1447: .asciiz "\nMarcus laughs at first, then sees the state of disarray you appear to be in, and the fearful expression on your face.  As he picks up your sister and runs upstairs, you run to the back door and lock that as well.  You join Marcus and Xing, who are hiding in your room.\n"
	date1448: .asciiz "\nHide under the bed, Xing.  Marcus, where's your phone?\n"
	date1449: .asciiz "\nI left it downstairs.  Where's yours?\n"
	date14491: .asciiz "\nI-It fell outta my pocket when I ran through the forest--\n"
	date14492: .asciiz "\nYou both freeze at the sound of the front door being broken down.  Xing whimpers under the bed.  Slowly, you hear Will stomping up the stairs and Marcus tenses beside you.  The door to your room is broken down, and Will stands there with the knife in his hands.\n"
	date14493: .asciiz "\nBefore you have the chance to do anything, Marcus tackles Will and the knife flys into the air, dropping down right beside you.  You kick it away into the corner, then look back; Marcus and Will are grabbing, punching and bashing each other, yet neither is gaining an advantage over the other.\n"
	
	rock1: .asciiz "\nYou move as silently as you can before hiding.  The doors to the rink slam open and Will moves forward, unaware you're now behind him.  Shaking from fear, you step forward and raise the rock above your head.  Just as Will realizes you're there, he turns with his knife ready to stab you, but it's too late; you slam the rock into his head with all your strength.  He falls to the floor, and you keep going until there's tears in your eyes and blood on the floor, on your clothes, on the rock...  You start sobbing and are almost unable to catch your breath.\n\nThrough the haze of all the thoughts flying through your head, you manage to take out your phone and call the police, telling them what happened.  Later, when the police, your mother, sister and Marcus show up, you're sitting on the seat of a police car, shock blanket wrapped around you.  Everyone crowds around to try and comfort you, but they can't.  You just had the  worst date of your life.\n"
	
	date14494: .asciiz "\nThey both stand and face each other, but Will slips and falls, tumbling down the stairs.  You and Marcus stare in horror as Will remains still.  The ordeal is over, yet you're all still left with a feeling of dread.\n"
	deadEnd: .asciiz "\nCongratulations, you've died.  At this date ended well for Will :)\n"
	deadEnd2: .asciiz "\nCongratulations, you've survived.  Unfortunately, you've killed your date.  Better luck next time, I guess.\n"
	date2: .asciiz "\nDid you rent the place out or did everyone run at the sight of the gay couple walking in?\n"
	date21: .asciiz "\nGay couple?  Where?\n"
	date22: .asciiz "\n...Us, Will.  We're the only people in here, period.\n"
	date23: .asciiz "\nWill looks alarmed\n"
	date24: .asciiz "\nI'm straight, Sunny.  I-I thought we were just hanging out.\n"
	date25: .asciiz "\nYou look at Will, wide-eyed, then laugh\n"
	date26: .asciiz "\nHaha, Will you should see your face.  Of course I knew that, I'm just joking around.  C'mon, let's go get our skates.\n\nYou walk ahead, hoping he assumes the blush on your face is due to the cold instead of the embarrassment.\n"
	date3: .asciiz "\nThe apocalypse came and we were the only ones not to know about it, huh?\n"
	date31: .asciiz "\nHa, no.  My uncle owns the rink, so I asked him to keep it clear for us.  Here, let's go get our skates.\n"
	counter: .asciiz "\nYou both walk to the counter and start looking for your size.  Will pulls out his dufflebag from behind the counter, bringing out his skates.\n"
	date32: .asciiz "\n\n"
	dot: .asciiz "\n...\n"
	dotHi: .asciiz "\n...Hi\n"
	strap: .asciiz "\nYou both strap into your shoes then walk together towards the rink.  You struggle because you rarely go out skating, and Will holds an amused smile on his face as he watches.\n"
	ice: .asciiz "\nHe lets you walk onto the ice first, and immiediately you fall flat on your face.  When you lift your head up, there's blood running down from your broken nose.\n"
	ice1: .asciiz "\nHoly Moly, Sunny!  Are you alright?\n"
	ice1Options: .asciiz "\nOption 1: Be Truthful\nOption 2: Brush it off, you're fine\n"
	ice21: .asciiz "\nShit, this hurts.\n"
	ice211: .asciiz "\nOh, I bet.  You fell pretty hard.  Why don't you go clean up?  I'll be out here trying to...get the blood off the ice.\n"
	ice212: .asciiz "\nGeez, I'm sorry Will.  I'll help you when I get back.\n"
	ice213: .asciiz "\nIt's fine, Sunny.  Just go on ahead.  The bathrooms are over there, to the left.\n"
	ice214: .asciiz "\nYou thank Will and walk off the ice.  Embarrassing.  You find the mirrors quickly once you enter the bathroom.  You cringe at your reflection.  Your nose is now crooked and the blood, still running down your chin, has stained your shirt.\n"
	bathroom: .asciiz "\nOption 1) Try to fix your nose\nOption 2) Try to clean off your shirt in the sink\n"
	
	nose1: .asciiz "\nYou stare at your reflection for a few more moments, trying to psych yourself up and preparing for the pain to come.  You lift your hands to you nose and quickly realign it.  There's a loud crack and you shout, but otherwise, you're alright.  You're used to doing this from the occasional soccer injury.\nWhen you're done cleaning the blood off your face, you walk back out to the rink.  Will is waiting next to the little pink stain on the ice.\n"
	nose2: .asciiz "\nGeez, now that all of that mess is out of the way, we can do what we came here to do.\n"
	nose3: .asciiz "\nThroughout the night, You and Will are holding each other, arm in arm.  It wasn't romantic or anything, you just suck at skating and Will, as a hockey player, was the only thing keeping you from falling again.  When the time was reaching close to midnight, you two decide to drive home.\n"
	nose4: .asciiz "\nWhen you two pull up to your driveway, Will turns off the car and walks you to the front door.  You both say your goodbyes, but neither leaves...\n"
	noseOption: .asciiz "\nOption 1) Help him out\nOption 2) End the night better than it started\n"
	
	helpHim1: .asciiz "\nYou both stare into each others eyes.  Will leans forward just a little, but you stop him.\n\nI've just wanted to say this all night, but you got something stuck in your teeth from when we stopped and grabbed dinner.  Anyways, thanks for hanging out with me, Will.  Good night.\n"
	helpHim2: .asciiz "\nYou smile at him, turn around and walk inside.  Will, wide-eyed and stunned speechless, walks to his car and drives off.\n"
	
	better1: .asciiz "\nYou both stare into each others eyes.  Will leans forward just a little, and you follow his lead.  The kiss started awkward.  Will forgot to close his eyes, and there was too much teeth, but in the end, he got the hang of it.  You both step apart \n"
	
	shirt1: .asciiz "\nYou pull your shirt off and turn the water on.  As you try and scrub the blood off with your hands, the drops that are still on your face begin to dry.  Behind you, the door to the bathroom opens up and Will walks in.\n"
	shirt2: .asciiz "\nOkay, Sunny, you ready--\n"
	shirt3: .asciiz "\nYou turn around and face Will.  He's staring at you, blushing.  You don't know what the problem is, you're both guys.  Just as you're about to ask if he's okay, his nose starts bleeding, then he faints.\n"
	shirt4: .asciiz "\nWhat the hell, Will?!\n"
	shirt5: .asciiz "\nYou rush over and check if he's okay, then bring out your phone to call an ambulance.\n"
	later: .asciiz "\n -- Later --\n"
	shirt6: .asciiz "\nWill's in the hospital, but he's fine.  All that happened was his blood pressure went up.  He's being discharged at the momnet by his parents.  The three of them pass you on their way out the door; his parents glare with disdain but Will looks embarrassed.  Because your mom works at the hospital, you wait for her to clock out so you can go home.\nThat whole, short date was all completely horrible.\nWill you be able to face Will back at school?  As you think this, you hear footsteps stop right in front of you.  You lift your head just slightly and see a pair of dark brown oxfords before you.\nYou lift your head completely and see your friend Mason, looking confused and slightly amused.\n"
	shirt7: .asciiz "\nSunny, what are you doing here?\n"
	shirt8: .asciiz "\nHey, Mason.  Nothing much.  Will and I were hanging out when he fainted, so I brought him here.  Now I'm just waiting for my mom so that we can go home.  What're you doing here?\n"
	shirt9: .asciiz "\nMy father owns the hospital and wanted me to grab some files from his office for him.  I was just about to head out, would you like a ride home?\n"
	shirt10: .asciiz "\nOh, no thanks, Mason.  I don't wanna bother you.\n"
	shirt11: .asciiz "\nHonestly Sunny, I don't mind.  Come on, I parked close.\n"
	shirt12: .asciiz "\nMason starts walking out the exit and you decide to go with him.  You make sure to text your mom after you get in the car.  Mason begins driving and you two sit in a comfortable silence.\n"
	shirt13: .asciiz "\nSo what'd you two do while you were 'hangning out'?\n\nAfter Mason asks this, you snort a laugh.\n"
	shirt14: .asciiz "\nNothing, actually.  We barely arrived when I broke my nose and he fainted.\n"
	shirt15: .asciiz "\nMason let out a breathy laugh before saying, 'That sounds awful'.  He's right, though, and you start to laugh quietly as well.\n"
	shirt16: .asciiz "\nMaybe I can fix your night?\n"
	shirt17: .asciiz "\nYou look over at Mason, confused.  Was he offering to take you out?  He glances over at you and smiles.  You decide...\n"
	shirtOptions: .asciiz "\nOption 1) To go home.  Despite this night being short, you're still tired.\nOption 2) To go with Mason.  You really need something to make you forget of that disaster of a 'date' with Will.\n"
	homeMason1: .asciiz "\nNo thanks, Mason.  I'm pretty tired and Marcus is at my place watching my sister.\n"
	homeMason2: .asciiz "\nHm... Maybe next time then? \nHe glances over at you and smiles softly.  You look away, but are smiling as well.\n\nOnce you get home, Mason gets out the car and opens your door for you and you roll your eyes fondly.  You stand facing each other and you nervously peck him on the cheek.  Mason looks surprised for one second before he says, 'So, does Sunday night work for you?'\n"
	homeMason3: .asciiz "\nCongratulations, your date with Will was a horrible failure.  Fortunately for you, Mason came along.\n"
	dateMason1: .asciiz "\nYou know what?  Yeah, I'll take you up on your offer.  Where do you feel like going?\n"
	dateMason2: .asciiz "\nJust a small restaurant nearby that plays live music every night.  It's food is pretty good.\n"
	dateMason3: .asciiz "\nIt's not fancy or anything, right?  I'm dressed to go skating, plus I still have blood on my shirt.\n"
	dateMason4: .asciiz "\nDon't worry about it.\nHe leans over and pecks you on the cheek.  You blush heavily and look at him.\nYou look good no matter what you wear.\n"
	dateMason5: .asciiz "\nWhen you two arrive at the restaurant, everything goes smoothly.  Because he's a regular, Mason has his own booth reserved in a quiet and private area in the back.  When you two sit down, convesation rolled on and never stopped other than to eat or talk to the waiter that came by.\n\nAt some point, while your hand was sitting on the table, Mason reaches over and lays his own on top of yours.  You blush and look up at him.\n\nAs the night passes by and you and Mason are driving off, you decide to take Mason up on another offer.  You call your mom and announce you won't be home tonight.\n"
	dateMason6: .asciiz "\nCongratulations, you had two dates in one night.  One ended better than the other, though, if you know what I mean...\n"
	
	ice22: .asciiz "\nYeah, of course, of course.  I'm totally fine, let's just keep going.\n"
	ice221: .asciiz "\nU-um are you sure?  You're bleeding out quite a bit.\n"
	ice222: .asciiz "\nYeah, don't worry about me\n"
	ice223: .asciiz "\nYou pick yourself up.  There's a lot more blood on the ice than you thought there'd be.  It's also still rushing down your chin.  You're starting to feel light-headed.\n"
	ice224: .asciiz "\nSunny?  Woah, Sunny!\n"
	ice225: .asciiz "\nYou hear Will yelling your name as you faint and fall to the ice again.  You're definitely going to have a concussion after this.\n\n\n\n"
